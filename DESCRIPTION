Title: Convenient Tool for Solving the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree Problem
Description: The Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree problem asks to find a subgraph
    connecting a given set of vertices with the most expensive nodes and least
    expensive edges. Since it is proven to be NP-hard, exact and efficient algorithm
    does not exist. This package provides convenient functionality for obtaining an
    approximate solution to this problem using loopy belief propagation algorithm.
